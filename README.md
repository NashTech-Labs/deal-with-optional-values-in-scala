# Deal with Optional values in Scala

- This template will help you to understand how to deal with optional values in Scala by using the Option type.
- Scala ```Option[T]``` is a container for single or no element of the given type T.
- An Option[T] can be either ```Some[T]``` or ```None``` object, which represents a missing value.
- For instance, the get method of Scala's Map produces Some(value) if a value corresponding to a given key has been found, or None if the given key is not defined in the Map.
- So the Option type in Scala makes it easier to write robust code if we use it as intended throughout our application code.

## Prerequisites
